# Lab Databases
Lab exercises. Introduction to Information Technology. Databases. Based on Sullivan, Dan. NoSQL for mere mortals. 

This course of the Khan Academy teaches how to create your own database:

The school library provides several books as online resources. You can access them through the library databases link: https://www.himolde.no/bibliotek/english/databases/ in the Database Ebook Central ProQuest - E-books in full text. 

We are not going to delve into the details of Database design because you are going to have a course in Databases on the next semester. In this class we will show you what you can do with databases. At the end of this class you will be able to create a simple database and use it in your project.

Objective: To show you that the choice of your databases depends on your requirements

#NoSQL databases:
The most widely used types of NoSQL databases are:
- Key-Value pair: DynamoDB, LevelDB, Riak, Tokyo/Kyoto Cabinet, Oracle NoSQL DB
- Document: MongoDB, CouchDB
- Column family store: Hypertable. MariaDB, Apache HBase
- Graph Databases: Neo4J, DEX, GraphBase, GraphChi

### Key-Value pair databases
<!--Introduction to the technology: explain the data model (what makes all the systems in the class similar)-->
<!--Gives an assessment of the types of workloads for which it is and is not well-suited.-->
<!--Compares several of the specific products in the class, contrasting the things that are different between systems.-->
