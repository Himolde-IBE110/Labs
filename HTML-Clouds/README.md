# Labs
Lab exercises. Introduction to Information Technology. Web technologies. 
Based on https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_html.asp, Edx course HTML5 and CSS Fundamentals*, Khan Academy https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-html/pt/css-basics and https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/
If you find this topic intersting, you can take the courses at https://aws.amazon.com/training/ 

The school library provides several books as online resources. You can access them through the library databases link: https://www.himolde.no/bibliotek/english/databases/ in the Database Ebook Central ProQuest - E-books in full text. 

In the next assignment, you will create a Web page and publish it in the Cloud. The objective in this lab is that you learn by doing.

As you already know, the Web is an information system where resources are identified by URLs and can be accessed via the HTTP protocol. It is based on 3 technologies: 
- the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and clients (browsers) should take in response to a message received. 
- The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). It is the markup language we use to write documents that can be displayed in a Web browser.  The current HTML version is HTML5. Modern Web pages and Web applications are generally composed of at least three components, so what people often mean when they say 'HTML5' is the trio of languages: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
  - The 'HTML' part contains all the content, organized into a logical structure.  This is the part that an author might be most concerned with: the words, chapter headings, figures, diagrams, etc. HTML5 was developed to provide more powerful and flexible ways for developers to create dynamic Web pages.
  - The 'CSS' part (version 3 being current) is all about the presentation or style of the page; what it looks like without too much regard for the specific content. You may think of it as the way you might specify a "theme" in a word processing document, setting fonts, sizes, indentations and whatever else may apply to what it looks like. 
  - The 'JavaScript', or 'JS' for short, part is about the actions a page can take such as interaction with the user, and customizing and changing the page according to any number of parameters.  This is what allows a Web page to be more than just a document, but potentially a Web application. 
- A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) allows to refer to a Web resource (web pages, images, etc), specifying its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.

## Improving my first Web page.
You have already created your first Web page in the Wireshark lab. In this lab you are going to improve it a little. Remember that you can build and edit your HTML pages by either using online editors or editors that you can install on your machine like Visual Studio Code. In the demonstration we will use the JSBin online editor (https://jsbin.com/?html,output) 

Open up a new tab and go to jsbin.com. Remember there is no need to login or register. Open this page in your browser https://himolde-ibe110.github.io/Labs/hello.html) and paste its code in the left panel of jsbin.
